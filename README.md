# Student-Performance-Analysis

Utilizing Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, I spearheaded a comprehensive data analysis 
project aimed at uncovering the underlying elements influencing students' academic performance.
I meticulously cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data to extract actionable insights. Employing Pandas for data 
manipulation, I engineered features and conducted exploratory data analysis to identify correlations and patterns within the dataset.
